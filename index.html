<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Philadelphia">In West Philadelphia</a>, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days:

<ul>
	<li>Chilling out</li>
	<li>Maxing</li>
	<li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
<p>I was shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys - they were up to no good - started making trouble in my neighborhood.</p>

<p>I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said,</p>
<p>"You'll move in with your Auntie and your Uncle in Bel-Air."</p>
